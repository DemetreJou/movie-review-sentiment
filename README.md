# A simple react + flask project


## Setup
This is run dockerized for easy production deployment(also because I wanted docker practice)

I'm self hosting everything even if heroku is easier to startup on (also because I wanted the practice)

Everything is dockerized but can be run standalone locally

Going to run frontend and backend in different containers, use traefik as reverse proxy when deployed, no need for database yet
